# JAPANESE TEMPLE

mi22028 - Jovana Brkljač 


This project shows a 3D scene of a traditional Asian-style 
building (temple) on a grassy hill.
There are two trees: a dead tree on the left and a healthy cherry blossom tree on the right. 
Pink petals fall and move gently through the air, and they appear to come from the dead tree. 
When the petals start moving, the directional light in the scene changes to a soft pink color, adding a magical and peaceful feeling.
The blooming lamps and wonderful sky are giving a cozy feeling.
